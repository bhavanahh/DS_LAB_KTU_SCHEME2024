🧠 BASICS OF DATA STRUCTURE LAB – VIVA QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

1. What is a Data Structure?

Answer:
A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.
Examples: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs.


---

2. What is the difference between linear and non-linear data structures?

Answer:

Linear Data Structures: Data elements are arranged sequentially (e.g., Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List).

Non-Linear Data Structures: Data elements are connected in a hierarchical or network manner (e.g., Tree, Graph).



---

3. What is an array?

Answer:
An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations and accessed using an index.


---

4. What are the advantages of arrays?

Answer:

Easy to access elements using an index.

Efficient in memory management for fixed-size data.

Useful for implementing other data structures.



---

5. What are the limitations of arrays?

Answer:

Fixed size (cannot grow or shrink).

Insertion and deletion are costly operations.

Homogeneous elements only.



---

6. What is a linked list?

Answer:
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements (called nodes) are linked using pointers. Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.


---

7. What are the types of linked lists?

Answer:

1. Singly Linked List


2. Doubly Linked List


3. Circular Linked List




---

8. What are the advantages of linked lists over arrays?

Answer:

Dynamic size.

Easy insertion and deletion.

Efficient memory utilization.



---

9. What is a stack?

Answer:
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
Example: Undo operation in text editors.
Operations: Push, Pop, Peek/Top.


---

10. What is a queue?

Answer:
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
Example: Ticket booking system, printer queue.
Operations: Enqueue (insert), Dequeue (delete).


---

11. Difference between stack and queue?

Stack	Queue

LIFO	FIFO
Insertion and deletion at the same end	Insertion at rear, deletion at front
Example: Function call stack	Example: Print queue



---

12. What is a circular queue?

Answer:
A circular queue connects the last position back to the first position to make a circle. It helps utilize unused space of a normal queue.


---

13. What is a tree?

Answer:
A tree is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, where one node is the root, and others are children.


---

14. What is a binary tree?

Answer:
A binary tree is a tree where each node has at most two children — a left child and a right child.


---

15. What is a binary search tree (BST)?

Answer:
A BST is a binary tree where the left child contains smaller values and the right child contains larger values than the parent node.


---

16. What are tree traversal methods?

Answer:

1. Inorder (Left, Root, Right)


2. Preorder (Root, Left, Right)


3. Postorder (Left, Right, Root)




---

17. What is a graph?

Answer:
A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect them.
Types: Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Unweighted.


---

18. What is the difference between a tree and a graph?

Answer:

A tree is a special type of graph with no cycles.

A graph can have cycles and multiple connections between nodes.



---

19. What is sorting?

Answer:
Sorting is arranging data in a particular order (ascending or descending).
Common Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort.


---

20. What is searching?

Answer:
Searching means finding the location of an element in a data structure.
Types:

Linear Search – Sequentially checks each element.

Binary Search – Divides sorted data into halves for faster searching.



---

21. What is recursion?

Answer:
Recursion is a process where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a smaller instance of a problem.


---

22. What are the applications of stacks?

Answer:

Expression evaluation (Postfix/Prefix)

Function calls

Undo operations

Backtracking algorithms



---

23. What are the applications of queues?

Answer:

Scheduling processes in operating systems

Printer queues

Data buffers



---

24. What is the difference between static and dynamic memory allocation?

Answer:

Static: Memory is allocated at compile time (e.g., array).

Dynamic: Memory is allocated at runtime using pointers (e.g., linked list).



---

25. What are the time complexities of common operations?

Operation	Best Case	Average Case	Worst Case

Linear Search	O(1)	O(n)	O(n)
Binary Search	O(1)	O(log n)	O(log n)
Insertion in Linked List	O(1)	O(1)	O(1)
Sorting (Merge/Quick)	O(n log n)	O(n log n)	O(n²)
